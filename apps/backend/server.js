/**
 * Graceful Shutdown Logic
 * -----------------------
 * This code ensures the Node.js server shuts down safely when the process
 * receives termination signals (SIGINT or SIGTERM).
 *
 * - SIGINT  → Sent when the user presses Ctrl + C in the terminal
 * - SIGTERM → Sent by external systems (like Docker, Kubernetes, PM2)
 *
 * Why we need this:
 * Without graceful shutdown, the app would exit immediately and:
 *   ❌ Drop in-flight HTTP requests
 *   ❌ Leave MongoDB connections hanging
 *   ❌ Risk corrupted data or memory leaks
 *
 * With this shutdown function:
 *   ✅ Stop accepting new requests
 *   ✅ Allow ongoing requests to finish
 *   ✅ Disconnect cleanly from MongoDB
 *   ✅ Exit with status code 0 (success)
 */

const shutdown = async (signal) => {
  console.log(`${signal} received. Shutting down gracefully...`);

  // Stop accepting new HTTP requests, wait for ongoing ones to finish
  server.close(async () => {
    console.log("✅ Closed out remaining HTTP connections");

    // Disconnect MongoDB client
    await mongoose.disconnect();
    console.log("✅ MongoDB connection closed");

    // Exit process with success code
    process.exit(0);
  });
};

// Listen for termination signals from OS or user
process.on("SIGTERM", () => shutdown("SIGTERM")); // e.g., Docker stop, Kubernetes pod shutdown
process.on("SIGINT", () => shutdown("SIGINT")); // e.g., Ctrl + C in terminal
