# Maps Architecture Refactor - Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Monolithic Component Problem**

- **Before**: Single 640+ line `index.jsx` file with everything mixed together
- **After**: Clean separation of concerns with 8 focused components

### 2. **State Management Issues**

- **Before**: Local useState with mock data directly in components
- **After**: Global state management using React Context + useReducer pattern

### 3. **Code Reusability Problems**

- **Before**: Inline component definitions that couldn't be reused
- **After**: Proper component files that can be imported and tested independently

### 4. **Props Passing & API Design**

- **Before**: No proper props interface, tight coupling
- **After**: Clean props interfaces with proper TypeScript-style patterns

## New Architecture

### **Context Layer** (`/context/`)

- `MapsContext.jsx` - Global state management with useReducer
- Actions, state, and custom hooks (useMapsState, useMapsDispatch, useMaps)
- Real-time updates handled at context level

### **Service Layer** (`/services/`)

- `mapsAPI.js` - Centralized API service with proper error handling
- Simulated async operations with realistic delays
- Clean separation between data fetching and UI

### **Component Layer** (`/components/`)

- `MapView.jsx` - Pure Leaflet map component with markers
- `Sidebar.jsx` - Reusable sidebar with animation and proper state management
- `LayerControls.jsx` - Reusable layer visibility controls
- `AmbulanceDetails.jsx` - Focused ambulance detail component with actions
- `HospitalDetails.jsx` - Hospital-specific details with capacity visualization
- `HotspotDetails.jsx` - Emergency hotspot component with recommendations

### **Main Component** (`index.jsx`)

- Clean 100-line file focused on composition
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Provider pattern implementation

## Key Improvements

### **Maintainability**

- Each component has single responsibility
- Easy to test individual components
- Clear dependency injection through props

### **Reusability**

- Sidebar component can be used elsewhere
- Detail components follow consistent patterns
- API service can be extended or replaced

### **State Management**

- Centralized state with predictable updates
- Real-time features properly managed
- Clean separation of business logic

### **Performance**

- Components only re-render when needed
- Proper React patterns for optimization
- Clean unmounting and effect cleanup

### **Developer Experience**

- Easy to find and modify specific features
- Clear file structure and naming
- Proper error handling and loading states

## File Structure

```
maps/
├── index.jsx (100 lines) - Main component
├── context/
│   └── MapsContext.jsx - Global state
├── services/
│   └── mapsAPI.js - API layer
└── components/
    ├── MapView.jsx - Leaflet map
    ├── Sidebar.jsx - Reusable sidebar
    ├── LayerControls.jsx - Layer toggles
    ├── AmbulanceDetails.jsx - Ambulance info
    ├── HospitalDetails.jsx - Hospital info
    └── HotspotDetails.jsx - Hotspot info
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Quality**: From 640 lines to properly separated concerns
2. **Testability**: Each component can be unit tested
3. **Reusability**: Components follow proper React patterns
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to modify individual features
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new entity types or features
6. **Performance**: Proper React optimization patterns
7. **Developer Experience**: Clear structure and dependencies

This refactor transforms a monolithic, hard-to-maintain component into a professional, scalable architecture that follows React best practices.
